# Private Projects

This repository lists some of the private or internal projects I've worked on over the years.

Most of these were developed for clients, research, or experimental purposes and are not publicly available due to confidentiality, ownership, or ongoing development.

If you're interested in any of these projects, want to discuss similar ideas, or explore collaboration opportunities, feel free to get in touch.

## Industry and Automations

### XPM Framework

<img src="/projects/industry-and-automations/xpm-framework/xpm-framework-1.jpg" width="40%">
<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="/projects/industry-and-automations/xpm-framework/xpm-framework-2.jpg" width="20%">
  <img src="/projects/industry-and-automations/xpm-framework/xpm-framework-3.jpg" width="20%">
</div>

Web framework built for environments where milliseconds matter.

In industry and manufacturing fields machines often need to connect with canonical OS (like Linux) that for various reasons need to show interfaces using web pages.

In those environments it's crucial to display a nice UI/UX avoiding unnecessary calculations, to decrease the workload of the machine rendering the page.

I created a basic framework that you could find similar to React, but way faster:

- Fewer features by design, making it suitable for medium-sized applications
- Allows development as fast as React (for small and medium scopes)
- Drastically reduces computation and re-renders, since rendering is fully developer-controlled
- It gives many automated behaviours to work with rendering, global data and calculations

For example you can choose how to re-render a list specifying:

- If it's expected to be ordered
- How is going to be updated (by adding, changing, removing items or all at once)
- When should be re-rendered and when it's not necessary

Those specifics makes it 2 to 5 times faster then React (tested rendering the same 100 elements both in XPM and React).

**Current status**
- In production since 2023
- Powers packaging systems handling ~3 items/second
- Used in mid-size manufacturing companies

### Theme

<img src="/projects/industry-and-automations/theme/theme-1.jpg" width="40%">

Web based UI theme used to build custom interfaces for industry and manufacturing fields, both for XPM and React.

**Current status**
- In production since 2023
- Used in 5 XPM and React projects

### PHP API

<img src="/projects/industry-and-automations/php-api/php-api-1.jpg" width="40%">

Module exposing a complete set of PHP REST API used in industry and manufacturing fields.

**Current status**
- In production since 2021
- Used in 5 projects

### Documents Builder

<img src="/projects/industry-and-automations/document-builder/document-builder-1.jpg" width="40%">

In some fields pages, documents or labels need to be created and then sent to devices like printers, PLCs or modbus as data to be processed or printed.

I built a system that allows users to create those documents from a web page, and export or transmit them to the correct devices.

**Current status**
- In production since 2025
- Used as part of 2 new softwares

### Back-office / MES

## WordPress

Tools or plugins developed to work with complex WordPress websites.

### Smart Modules

<img src="/projects/wordpress/smart-modules/smart-modules-1.jpg" width="40%">

Started as a code block for internal use that can be included in child themes, now it's a `MU-Plugin`.

It anticipated the `MU-Plugins` logic, allowing to develop separated, optimized and easily maintainable modules that can be added to the WordPress website with low efforts.

Now, thanks to the `MU` logic, is even more powerful since it enables an internal marketplace where shared and tested modules can be downloaded and used with minimal configuration.

It also introduces a new way to handle settings, way faster than the WordPress default, that works perfectly but also grants better performances and drastically reduces queries: a single query for all options used in all the modules, and no risk to load "too much" since the options retrieval system is optimized.

**Current status**
- Working in 3 websites and 1 SaaS
- Higher priorities stopped its diffusion, if you are interested we could improve it and share it as `MU-Plugin`

### Custom Fields

<img src="/projects/wordpress/custom-fields/custom-fields-1.jpg" width="40%">
<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="/projects/wordpress/custom-fields/custom-fields-2.jpg" width="20%">
  <img src="/projects/wordpress/custom-fields/custom-fields-3.jpg" width="20%">
  <img src="/projects/wordpress/custom-fields/custom-fields-4.jpg" width="20%">
</div>

Plugin built for specific situations where:
- An high number of request are mode on posts or custom types
- Requests need to filter or manipulate data using custom fields
- Import and export needs to be simple and maintainable
- Introucing plugins like `ACF` decrease performances since every filtered request takes to much to join tables and perform checks or updates on custom fields
- Data should be visible and filtered by front-end users, in highly customizable tables with a tailor made UI

In this case it's the perfect plugin, since:
- It works with a single table perfectly integrated with `wp_posts` (without changing any WP native table or logic)
- It allows to filter any kind of data (also nested) with 1 or 2 (max) queries
- Allows to safely show only certain fields on front-end components
- Allows to use a tailor made table component where each column and filter can be customized (also injecting safe JS code in specific hooks)
- Allows to add buttons and panels to export data in CSV and XLSX formats

**Current status**
- Working in 1 website and used internally
- Higher priorities stopped its diffusion, if you are interested we could improve it and share it as `WordPress Plugin`

### XLog

<img src="/projects/wordpress/xlog/xlog-1.jpg" width="40%">

`MU-Plugin` creating a logging system that tracks and shows in a custom webpage PHP warnings, informations and errors, setting a custom log level to:
- Debug while working
- Detect strange behaviours or unnecessary operations
- Run security checks

**Current status**
- Working when needed on 5 websites, activated only when needed (to debug, detect or run checks)
